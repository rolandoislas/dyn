The script "rfid.lua" provides a command line interface to read and write a string to an RFID chip.

Usage:

rfid <command>

Commands:

- read
  Searches for the nearest RFID chip and prints its data as a string.
- write <string_to_write>
  Searches for the nearest RFID chip and writes the string value to it

Note: Authentication is performed with the default key (0xffffff). If authentication or a read/write fails, the operation will stop and an error will be displayed.
